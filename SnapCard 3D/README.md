A modern, web-based tool for creating stunning, comic-style 3D trading cards. Inspired by dynamic digital card games, SnapCard 3D allows you to upload your own artwork, customize titles and frames, and view your creation in a realistic 3D environment with dynamic lighting and glare effects.

## Features

*   **3D Interactive Preview**: Drag sliders to tilt and rotate your card in 3D space with real-time dynamic glare.
*   **Dual Shapes**: Switch between the classic rectangular **Card** and the unique circular **Lens** format.
*   **Deep Customization**:
    *   Upload your own images or GIFs.
    *   Adjust zoom, pan, and positioning.
    *   Customize frame colors, gradient overlays, and fonts.
    *   Title effects including Polka Dots, Stripes, and Outline styling.
*   **Modern UI**: Built with a sleek Glassmorphism aesthetic using React and TypeScript.

## How to Run

This project uses modern ES Modules and imports dependencies directly via `esm.sh`. You do not need a complex build step (like Webpack), but you must serve the files via a local server to avoid CORS issues with modules.

1.  **Clone or Download** the files.
2.  **Start a Local Server** in the project directory:
    *   **Python**: `python3 -m http.server`
    *   **Node.js**: `npx http-server .`
    *   **VS Code**: Right-click `index.html` and use the "Live Server" extension.
3.  Open your browser to the local address (usually `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:8000`).
