**Jam Box** is a vibrant, interactive music player and boredom-toy hybrid. It combines a high-performance Web Audio API engine with a reactive, procedurally animated mascot that responds to your music, mouse movements, and activity levels.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Reactive Mascot**: A procedural "Blob" mascot with eye-tracking, physics-based dancing, and idle behaviors (it even takes naps!).
- **🎵 High-Fidelity Audio**: Powered by the Web Audio API with real-time frequency analysis.
- **📁 Drag & Drop**: Toss your local MP3s directly into the stage to start the party.
- **📱 PWA Enabled**: Install it on your desktop or mobile device. Works offline once cached.
- **📑 Smart Playlist**: Reorderable tracks via drag-and-drop, individual track progress bars, and persistent volume controls.
- **✨ Aesthetics**: A "Cartoon Mix" aesthetic with chunky borders, vibrant colors, and floating particle effects.
