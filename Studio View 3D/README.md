**StudioView 3D Pro** is a high-fidelity, industrial-grade 3D model inspector built for the modern web. It provides engineers and technical artists with a streamlined environment to inspect PBR materials, analyze scene geometry in real-time.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Advanced PBR Inspector:** Real-time adjustment of Albedo, Metalness, Roughness, Emissive, and Opacity nodes.
-   **Smart Edge Detection:** Custom shader-based edge detection for industrial wireframe and blueprint-style visualization.
-   **Multi-Format Support:** Seamlessly inject `.gltf`, `.glb`, and `.fbx` assets.
-   **Material Inheritance:** Automatically converts imported assets to standard PBR materials for consistent inspection.
-   **Workspace Customization:** Full control over UI accent colors, shell themes, and viewport backgrounds with persistent user presets.
-   **Scene Analytics:** Persistent tracking of object count, total polygons, and vertices—even when the sidebar is minimized.
-   **Lighting Presets:** Quickly toggle between Studio, Dramatic, Outdoor, and Flat lighting environments.
-   **Capture Suite:** High-resolution viewport screenshots with a single click.

## 🚀 Future Updates

We are committed to evolving StudioView. The following features are currently in development:

-   **Cleaner UI:** A refined, more minimalist interface to maximize viewport real estate.
-   **Better Scene Organization:** Enhanced hierarchy management with nesting support and multi-selection.
-   **Advanced Render Settings:** Post-processing stacks including SSAO, Bloom, and depth-of-field controls.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Frontend:** React 19 & Tailwind CSS
-   **3D Engine:** Three.js (R173)
-   **Icons:** Lucide React
-   **Deployment:** Optimized for modern ES6 module environments
